### Animated Landing Page (GSAP Mastery Project)
This project is part of my 60-day challenge to level up my front-end and motion design skills.

The goal of this landing page is to master **GSAP** and **ScrollTrigger** by building a smooth, interactive experience that feels alive, not static.

---

### Objectives

- Learn how to build complex animation **timelines** using GSAP.
- Implement **ScrollTrigger** to animate sections on scroll.
- Create a smooth **parallax** and **transition flow** between sections.
- Polish timing, easing, and visual hierarchy for professional motion.

---

### Tech Stack
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 / Flexbox**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **GSAP 3** + **ScrollTrigger Plugin**

### What I’ll Learn
- How to structure animations with `gsap.timeline()`
- How to use `ScrollTrigger` for scroll-based animations
- How to create smooth, fluid visual flow
- How to make motion *feel* intentional — not random

## Progress Plan
| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Setup project structure + GSAP         | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Build static HTML/CSS layout           | ✅ Done |
| 3 | Add hero intro animations              | 🔄 In progress |
| 4 | Add scroll-trigger animations          | ⏳ Pending |
| 5 | Polish transitions + deploy on Netlify | ⏳ Pending |

---

### Deployment

Coming soon — will be hosted on **Netlify** once the core animations are finished.

### Notes

Each project in this series builds specific skills:
- This one → GSAP & motion flow
- Next → JS logic and state management
- Then → Webflow + custom code integration
- Finally → Full dynamic web tool with JS + animations
